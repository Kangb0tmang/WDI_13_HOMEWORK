___
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework.](https://reduxframework.com/))

It helps you write applications that behave consitently, run in different environments (clients, server and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a greater developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time travelling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reduxframework.com/), or any other view library.   
It is tiny (2kb, including dependencies).

### Developer Experience
I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called ["Hot Reloading with Time Travel"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behaviour, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
